Best model based on RMSE: Poisson
Best model based on AIC: Negative Binomial

Key Findings:
1. The data shows significant over-dispersion, as indicated by the Cameron-Trivedi test.
2. There is evidence of zero-inflation in the data.
3. The Negative Binomial model generally outperforms the Poisson model due to its ability to handle over-dispersion.
4. The CORE tree provides interpretable splits that reveal important variable thresholds.
5. The number of mentors is the most important predictor of publication counts.
6. Gender, marital status, and having young children also impact publication productivity.
